# Probe findings

One entry per probe, appended when it runs: pass/fail against the criterion in
`README.md`, the number or fact it established, the capture path. Never edited after
the fact — a wrong finding gets a dated correction below it.



## box-upgrade — PASS (2026-08-22)

netcup Lite 1 → Lite 3 in place. `free -h` reports 15 Gi total after reboot
(16 GB nominal); both containers (`steamlens-app-1`, `box-proxy-caddy-1`) came back
unattended within a minute, `box-firewall` active, `/healthz` answers 200 from
outside with worker and database ok. Capture: `captures/box-upgrade/free-before.txt`,
`free-after.txt`.

Facts established beyond the criterion: the pre-upgrade box was **4 GB, not the 2 GB**
the baseline review and the TODO memory-split bullet assumed — re-derive the Compose
memory budget from the real numbers. Resting footprint ~550–650 MB (OS + app + Caddy,
idle). **No swap configured** — decide before the `frappe-up` probe.
